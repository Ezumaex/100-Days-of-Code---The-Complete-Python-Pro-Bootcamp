my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? It is going through from 1 to 19, checking if the number will be equal to 20.
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? Once the variable i get to 20.
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? The value of i will never achieve 20 as it is only limited with its range from 1 to 19.
